# Instagram Data Analysis

## Description

A comprehensive data analysis project focused on analyzing Instagram posts and engagement metrics. This project uses Python with Jupyter Notebook to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and data visualization on Instagram dataset.

## Objective

This project aims to:
- Analyze Instagram post performance metrics
- Identify trends and patterns in engagement
- Understand factors that influence post popularity
- Generate actionable insights from social media data
- Demonstrate data analysis and visualization techniques

## Dataset

The project includes:
- **Instagram data.csv**: Contains Instagram posts data with metrics such as likes, comments, shares, and engagement rates
- Complete data exploration and preprocessing
- Multiple dimensions of analysis

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Comprehensive exploration of dataset structure and distributions
- **Data Visualization**: Clear and informative visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis, trend analysis, and statistical tests
- **Engagement Metrics**: Analysis of likes, comments, shares, and follower impact
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Actionable insights based on data findings

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive data analysis environment
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning and statistical modeling (if applicable)
